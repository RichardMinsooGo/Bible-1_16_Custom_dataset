Imagenet does not provide the download. So, we need to download it other methods.

## Option 1

I saved at my Google Drive. You can donload it at the below link

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z24WZifwS_LAq7MwqQdOLu3-eNp0B9gM?usp=sharing

You can download each folders. Each folder have 200 training datasets.

"train_part1","train_part2", "train_part3", "train_part4", "train_part5" 

In this case, you are no need to download "ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar".

Then download the below three files.

ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar

train_set_labels.txt

validation_labels.txt


## Option 2

I saved at my Google Drive. You can donload it at the below link

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z24WZifwS_LAq7MwqQdOLu3-eNp0B9gM?usp=sharing

"ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar" have full imagenet training datasets.

Then download the below three files.

ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar

train_set_labels.txt

validation_labels.txt


## Option 3

Other download method is to use torrent. You can use three torrent files at my Google Drive.

ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar-a306397ccf9c2ead27155983c254227c0fd938e2.torrent

ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar-5d6d0df7ed81efd49ca99ea4737e0ae5e3a5f2e5.torrent

### Note. Due to the Colab policy change between 2021 ~ 2022, you cannot load using "gdown" at Colab. As my test, maximum loading capacity is about 30 Gbyte/day from Google drive to Colab.
